It is one of the simplest and most used encryption techniques. In this technique, each letter of the given text is replaced by a letter of some fixed
number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, X would be replaced by Y, Y would become Z, and so on. Julius Caesar was the first
one who used it for communicating with his officials. Based on his name, this technique was named as Caesar Cipher technique.
An integer value is required to cipher a given text. The integer value is known as shift, which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text
has been moved down.

## BDD
* After running the code, Select the process,
- Input either e for encoding or d for decoding

* Enter the message
- Input the message you want to display

* Enter the key
- Input the key number

* After getting the output displayed, choose whether to continue or to end
- Input continue or quit

**Example**
* When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain"
  line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.
- Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
- Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

**Expected output is either**

- Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
- Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD


## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Run the code
- Input either e for encoding or d for decoding
- Input the message you want to display
